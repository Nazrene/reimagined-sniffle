##Find My Dog - User Guide
Welcome to Find My Dog, a web application that connects dog lovers and dog owners. This guide will walk you through the steps to use the app effectively.

1. Finding a Dog Breed:

The "Find My Dog" web app allows users to search for specific dog breeds. Users can start by navigating to the app's main page.

On the main page, there is a search section where users can specify their preferences, including the desired dog breed. Users enter the name of the breed they are looking for.

For example, if a user is interested in adopting a Afghan Hound, they can put in 'Afghan Hound' in the contacting section of the page as the breed preference section.

2. Providing Email Address:

To facilitate communication and feedback, users are required to enter their email address. This is a way for sellers, breeders, or adopters to get in touch with each other.

The email address field is typically part of a contact form that appears when a user wants to inquire about a particular dog listing.

Users can enter their email address into the designated field on the contact form.

3. Dog Breed Preference:

Dogs on the page are listed with their characteristics and mannerisms to enable a buyer or adopter to choose the best fit for them. 

4. Choosing Intention (Adopting, Selling, Buying):

Users have the option to specify their intention when interacting with dog listings. This intention typically includes one of the following:

Adopting: If a user wants to provide a loving home to a dog in need of adoption.
Selling: If a user has dogs that they want to sell to other dog lovers.
Buying: If a user is interested in purchasing a dog.

5. Submitting for Feedback:

When users find a dog listing that matches their preferences they can use the contact form provided on the app.

The contact form typically includes fields for entering their email address,specifying the dog breed they need and specifying their intention (adopting, selling, buying).

After entering the required information, users can click the "Submit" button on the contact form to send their feedback or inquiry to the seller, breeder, or dog owner.

By following these steps, users of your "Find My Dog" app can efficiently find the dog breed they are interested in, express their intentions, and contact sellers, breeders, or owners for more information about the dogs listed on the platform.
